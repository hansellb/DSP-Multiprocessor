# DSP-Multiprocessor
Digital Image Processing on a Multiprocessor

Lab 2 for EIT/KTH Masters course IL2212 Embedded Software.

Taken from the Lab manual:

Objectives

The task of this laboratory is to implement a concurrent data-flow application in
different ways on the multiprocessor from Laboratory 1. Students shall apply
their knowledge from the lectures in order to derive an efficient implementation
exploiting the parallelism provided by the architecture.

During this laboratory students shall implement the application:
- On a single core using the real-time operating system MicroC/OS-II-
- On a single core without operating system
- On the multiprocessor without operating system

In all cases students shall try to optimize the following objectives: throughput and
memory footprint.

In addition students shall document their results in a technical report.
